Segment Integration replacement :

1. Go to '/integrations/analytics.js-integration-segmentio/lib/index.js'

2. change apiHost (backened endpoint) as per to your requirement (line number = 61 )
    eg. for test env (qa, uat),  apiHost = segment-uat.hopscotch.in
        for production env, apiHost = segment.hopscotch.in

3. Go to '/lib/index.js'

4. Import Integrations as per your requirement (line number = 9)
    (add required Integrations in integration folder and make an entry in respective env integration file)
    for test env (qa, uat),  var Integrations = require('../integrations/dev-integrations.js');
        for production env, var Integrations = require('../integrations/production-integrations.js');

5. run "make build" command (Node version should be v0.12.0)
    This will generate analytics.js and analytics.min.js files
    (check presence of apiHost(mentioned in 2nd point) in that files)

6. add required JSON configuration in '/config/${ENV}/${ENV}-integration-config.json'
    Then encrypt that JSON(stringify) using base64 encryption (atob and btob),
    now add/update that encrypted string in '/config/${ENV}/config.json' file.

7. Add/Upload latest created below mentioned files on respective CDN

    /analytics.js
    /analytics.min.js
    /config/${ENV}/config.json

    CDN Location :
            dev env => "https://qastatic.hopscotch.in/sass-dev/${files}"
            production => "https://static.hopscotch.in/sass-prod/${files}"

    (IMP NOTE:  Ask devops team to clear CDN cache as well.)

8. Add minified version of analytics-script.js in index.html of your project.

Now it should work as expected.
